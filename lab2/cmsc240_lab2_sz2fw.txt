Name:  YOUR NAME HERE

=====================================================================

Instructions: Delete (remove) any incorrect answers beneath each question.
    For example, if the first and fourth options are correct, you answer should
    leave those alone but delete the second and third options.

Lab Exercise #1:
----------------
1. What changes do you notice in the before and after versions?

   (a) no changes


2. Why?  Choose best explanation for answer to #1.

   (c) changeValue method uses pass-by-value parameters
 

3. What changes do you notice now in the before and after versions?

   (d) both ID and name change

4. Why?  Choose best explanation for answer to #3.

   (c) new method's parameters are pointer type, and dereferenced in the method
   

5. Choose best answer: code required when using pointer as parameter.

   (b) parameter must be declared type*, then dereferenced; call using address

6. Choose best answer: code required when using C++ reference as parameter.

   (a) parameter must be declared type&


7. Choose best answer: primary difference of pass-by-value vs. pass-by-reference

   (c) pass-by-reference allows method to modify value of argument


Lab Exercise #2:
----------------
8. What changes do you notice in the before and after versions?

   (b) anInt changes but intPtr does not
   
9. Choose best answer: justification of change to anInt or not


   (c) anInt changes because parameter is pointer type and dereferenced


10. Choose best answer: justification of change to intPtr or not

   (b) intPtr does not change b/c address in parameter is passed by value


Lab Exercise #3:
----------------
11. Choose best answer: explanation for intent of program as given.

   (a) allow user to modify struct data via standard input

12. Choose best answer: justification for accomplishing intent or not

   (d) pass-by-value parameters prohibit intent of program


13. Choose best answer: struct pointer parameter vs. struct reference parameter

   (c) if parameter is pointer, use arrow; if not pointer, use dot

Lab Exercise #4:
----------------
14. Select all below that, based on the provided C++ class, are correct.

   (e) C++ has a constructor with same name as the class, similar to Java
   (f) C++ has a destructor named like "~classname()"; Java does not
   (g) a C++ class method is declared in the .h header file
   (i) a C++ class method is defined in the .cpp file
   (j) when defined, a method name in a C++ class is preceded by "classname::"

15. Choose best answer: what are the data types of variables "first" & "second"?

   (e) first is pointer to Student; second is Student

16. Compile error:

   ProgramFour.cpp: In function ‘int main()’:
   ProgramFour.cpp:13:18: error: type ‘class Student’ argument given to ‘delete’, expected pointer
         delete(second);
                     ^


17. Choose best answer: explanation for compile error

   (d) delete can be used only for dynamically allocated memory

18. What changes in student info do you notice?

   (a) no changes

19. Explain previous answer: choose the best answer.

   (c) the newly created method uses pass-by-value


20. Explain why changes now persist: choose the best answer.

   (b) the method now uses pass-by-reference
